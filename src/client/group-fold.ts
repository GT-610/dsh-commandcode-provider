/**
 * Which of the settings page's five top-level groups are expanded, and where
 * that is remembered (决策记录第十章第4条).
 *
 * Accounts opens by default and the other four start folded, so the page's
 * first screen is the account list plus four one-line summaries. Whatever the
 * user then opens or folds is kept per browser profile in ONE `localStorage`
 * key holding all five flags: a group added or renamed later simply falls back
 * to its default, so no migration is ever needed. This is view state only — it
 * never enters the settings document and is not synced through the profile.
 *
 * Pure functions plus a storage adapter, so `tests/group-fold.test.ts` can pin
 * the parsing and fallbacks without a DOM.
